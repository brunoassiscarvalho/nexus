/* You can also define global styles that can penetrate Shadow DOM if needed,
   using CSS Custom Properties or by styling the host from outside.
   However, the components themselves have their own encapsulated styles for better modularity.
*/

/* Example of how you might style menu-button elements globally if they didn't use Shadow DOM
   or if you are targeting attributes.
   Since menu-button uses Shadow DOM, its internal button styling is encapsulated.
   Global styles like this won't affect the button inside menu-button's shadow root directly,
   unless using CSS custom properties passed down.
